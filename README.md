# KeySoundMaker
Little program that makes sounds as you use the keyboard. The idea is to make sounds of a mechanical keyboard for fun and stuff. Still figuring out if I can get used to the  sound of blue...

Currently it has no GUI, only works on Windows, the only configuration is hardcoded and it's mostly made of scraps of other people's code anyways. And I'm still figuring out git
The sounds are taken from rbino's project at https://github.com/rbino/softmech. You can share sound files between the two, but that's about it
