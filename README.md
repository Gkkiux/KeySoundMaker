# KeySoundMaker
Little program that makes sounds as you use the keyboard. The idea is to make sounds of a mechanical keyboard for recreational purposes (sound therapy, trolling, etc)

By default it takes sounds from "CMStormTKBlue" directory (currently hardcoded), but you can add your own and select it using tray icon (program restart required). It uses .wav files, named _down, _up for press and release, _space or _return for "special" keys.

The project was heavily inspired by https://github.com/rbino/softmech, it's the one you want if you're using Linux. The sounds were provided by rbino, both projects use the same format
